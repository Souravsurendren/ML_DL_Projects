## Overview

The following projects were developed to apply machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve real-world problems using structured and image-based data.

---

## Task 1: Credit Score Prediction Model

**Objective:** Predict a user's credit score category based on financial attributes using supervised learning techniques.

### Process:
- Data preprocessing & encoding
- Classification model (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix

---

##  Task 2: Disease Prediction Using Medical Data

**Objective:** Predict the likelihood of a person having a certain disease based on input symptoms and medical data.


### Process:
- Multi-class classification
- Model evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score
- Potential integration with a web interface

---

## Task 3: Handwritten Character Recognition Model

**Objective:** Build a CNN-based model to recognize handwritten alphabets (A-Z) from image datasets.

### Dataset:
- A-Z Handwritten Character Dataset or similar

### Process:
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation
- Data augmentation for improved accuracy
- Evaluation with training/validation loss graphs and accuracy scores

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- Jupyter Notebook
